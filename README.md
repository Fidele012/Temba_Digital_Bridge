## 1. Project Description

### Problem Statement

Access to clean water is a fundamental human right, yet millions of Rwandans still face daily challenges with water supply disruption, pipe bursts, contamination, and billing errors. The gap between affected communities and the water service providers responsible for resolving those issues is wide — residents have no reliable, structured way to report problems, track progress, or hold providers accountable. Meanwhile, providers lack visibility into their service quality and response times.

### What Temba Digital Bridge Does

**Temba Digital Bridge** (Kinyarwanda: *temba* — "to push forward") is a full-stack civic-tech platform that bridges this gap through four complementary components.

**Community Web Platform** — A responsive website where community members can:

- Register and set up a profile with their Rwanda administrative location (province → district → sector → cell → village)
- Submit detailed water issue reports with category, urgency level, and optional photos
- Book service appointments directly with water providers
- Track any submitted issue in real time using a unique reference code (e.g. `RPT-20260614-K7M3`)
- Receive in-app and SMS notifications at every stage of resolution
- Verify whether a provider's resolution actually fixed their problem

**USSD Feature-Phone Channel** — Accessible by dialling `*384*36640#` on any basic mobile phone, no internet required. Community members can:

- Register a Temba account entirely via feature phone, navigating Rwanda's full five-level administrative hierarchy through numbered menus
- Report water issues by selecting category and urgency from paginated menus
- Check the status of previously submitted reports
- Receive an SMS confirmation with a unique tracking code after every submission

**Provider Dashboard** — Water service organisations (WASAC, IRIBA, Pro Water Rwanda, and others) access a dedicated dashboard to:

- View all reports and service requests assigned to their organisation
- Update report status through a defined workflow (Acknowledged → Under Review → In Progress → Resolution Submitted)
- Manage team members (Supervisors, Regional Managers, Executives) with role-based access
- View SLA deadlines and receive escalation alerts when response times are breached
- Respond to appointment bookings and propose alternative times
- Set and manage availability so community members can book appropriate slots

**Admin Panel** — Platform administrators can:

- Approve or reject provider registrations
- Publish announcements and alerts to the platform
- Monitor platform-wide analytics (total reports, resolution rates, SLA compliance)
- View a full audit trail of every action taken on the platform

### What Makes This Unique

Unlike generic complaint portals, Temba is built specifically for Rwanda's administrative geography. The USSD registration flow contains the complete Rwanda administrative hierarchy — all 5 provinces, 30 districts, ~416 sectors, ~2,148 cells, and over 14,800 villages — presented as numbered paginated menus. This means a farmer in a rural cell with no smartphone can register and file a report in the same system as an urban professional using the web app.

The platform enforces a structured **accountability loop**: a report is not "closed" by the provider alone. The community member who submitted it must verify that the issue was genuinely resolved. If they dispute the resolution, the case escalates automatically — first to a supervisor, then a regional manager, then an executive — with SMS alerts at each level and SLA deadlines tracked per category (contamination and pipe bursts: 4-hour SLA; no supply: 24 hours; other issues: 72 hours).

The platform is also fully **bilingual**. Every USSD menu, every SMS notification, and every in-app label is available in both English and Kinyarwanda, toggled by the user's language preference — making the system genuinely accessible to all Rwandans.

### Target Users

| User Type | Access Method | Primary Need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Community Member (urban) | Web platform | File reports, book appointments, track issues |
| Community Member (rural) | USSD `*384*36640#` | File reports, receive SMS tracking codes |
| Water Provider Staff | Web dashboard | Manage reports, update status, respond to appointments |
| Platform Admin | Web admin panel | Approve providers, publish announcements, monitor health |

## 6. Getting Started

### 6.1 Prerequisites

Install the following tools before starting. Each link goes to the official download page.

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | 3.11 or 3.12 | Backend runtime |
| [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) | 16 | Primary database |
| [Redis](https://redis.io/download/) | 7 | Task queue + cache |
| [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) | latest | Run services (recommended) |
| [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | latest | USSD tunnel (development) |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | latest | Clone the repo |
| A modern browser | — | Access the web app |

> **Tip:** If you have Docker Desktop installed you do not need to install PostgreSQL or Redis separately — Docker will run them as containers.

---

### 6.2 Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fidele012/Temba_Digital_Bridge.git
cd Temba_Digital_Bridge
```

The project has two top-level folders:

```text
Temba_Digital_Bridge/
├── temba-backend/      # FastAPI Python backend
└── temba-v2/           # Frontend (HTML / CSS / JS)
```

---

### 6.3 Backend Setup

Choose **Option A (Docker — easiest)** or **Option B (manual install)**.

---

#### Option A — Docker Compose (Recommended)

This starts PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, the API server, the Celery worker, and Flower in a single command.

##### Step 1 — Create the environment file

```bash
cd temba-backend
cp .env.example .env
```

If `.env.example` does not exist, create `.env` manually with the content from [Section 7](#7-environment-variables) below.

##### Step 2 — Build and start all services

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Wait about 30 seconds for all containers to become healthy. Check status:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

All services should show `healthy` or `running`.

##### Step 3 — Run database migrations

```bash
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head
```

##### Step 4 — Seed initial data

```bash
docker compose exec api python seed_providers.py
```

##### Step 5 — Verify the API is running

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/docs`. You should see the Temba API Swagger documentation with all endpoints listed.

---

#### Option B — Manual (without Docker)

Use this if you prefer to install PostgreSQL and Redis directly on your machine.

##### Step 1 — Create and activate a Python virtual environment

```bash
cd temba-backend

# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

##### Step 2 — Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Step 3 — Set up PostgreSQL

Open `psql` (or pgAdmin) and run:

```sql
CREATE USER temba WITH PASSWORD 'temba_pass';
CREATE DATABASE temba_db OWNER temba;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE temba_db TO temba;
```

##### Step 4 — Set up Redis

Make sure Redis is running on the default port `6379`. On Windows use the Redis Windows installer or WSL. On macOS:

```bash
brew install redis && brew services start redis
```

##### Step 5 — Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in the values from Section 7
```

##### Step 6 — Run database migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

##### Step 7 — Seed initial data

```bash
python seed_providers.py
```

This creates three approved water providers and the admin account:

| Account | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | admin@temba.rw | Admin@Temba2025! |
| WASAC (Provider) | info@wasac.rw | Temba@Provider2025! |
| IRIBA Water Group | support@iriba.rw | Temba@Provider2025! |
| Pro Water Rwanda | hello@prowater.rw | Temba@Provider2025! |

##### Step 8 — Start the API server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

##### Step 9 — Start the Celery worker

Open a second terminal, activate the venv, then run:

```bash
celery -A app.worker worker --loglevel=info
```

---

### 6.4 Frontend Setup

The frontend is plain HTML / CSS / JavaScript — no build step required.

#### Step 1 — Open the project in VS Code

```bash
code temba-v2
```

#### Step 2 — Install the Live Server extension

In VS Code, install **Live Server** (by Ritwick Dey) from the Extensions panel.

#### Step 3 — Launch the app

Right-click `temba-v2/index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.

Your browser will open at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.

#### Step 4 — Verify the API connection

The frontend connects to the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default. Make sure the backend is running before logging in or submitting reports.

Available pages:

| Page | URL |
|---|---|
| Landing / Tracking | `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` |
| Sign In | `http://127.0.0.1:5500/signin.html` |
| Sign Up | `http://127.0.0.1:5500/signup.html` |
| Community Dashboard | `http://127.0.0.1:5500/dashboard-community.html` |
| Submit Report | `http://127.0.0.1:5500/report.html` |
| Provider Dashboard | `http://127.0.0.1:5500/dashboard-provider.html` |

---

### 6.5 Africa's Talking USSD Setup

The USSD channel lets feature-phone users access the platform by dialling `*384*36640#`.

#### Step 1 — Create an Africa's Talking account

Go to [africastalking.com](https://africastalking.com) → Sign Up → select Sandbox (free for development).

#### Step 2 — Get your API credentials

Dashboard → Settings → API Key. Copy the key into your `.env`:

```ini
AT_USERNAME=sandbox
AT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AT_SENDER_ID=+250790147995
AT_USSD_CODE=*384*36640#
```

#### Step 3 — Expose your local server with ngrok

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL shown, e.g. `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`.

#### Step 4 — Register the USSD callback

In the Africa's Talking dashboard:

- Go to **Sandbox → USSD → Create Channel**
- Set **Callback URL**: `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/api/v1/ussd/callback`
- Save

#### Step 5 — Test the USSD flow

In the Africa's Talking dashboard:

- Go to **Sandbox → Simulator**
- Enter a test phone number (e.g. `+250700000001`)
- Dial `*384*36640#`
- Navigate the menus to register, report an issue, or check a tracking code

After submitting a report, an SMS with the tracking code is sent to your test number. Enter that code at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` to track the issue.

---

#### Step 2 — Connect to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → Log in with GitHub
2. Click **Add New → Project**
3. Select your `Temba_Digital_Bridge` repository
4. In the configuration screen set:
   - **Framework Preset**: Other
   - **Root Directory**: `temba-v2`
   - **Build Command**: *(leave empty)*
   - **Output Directory**: `.`
5. Click **Deploy**

Vercel will give you a public URL like `https://temba-digital-bridge.vercel.app`.

#### Step 3 — Update the API base URL

Before deploying, find and replace across all files in `temba-v2/`:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Replace with your production backend URL:

```text
https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app
```

Then commit, push, and Vercel will automatically redeploy.

#### Step 4 — Custom domain (optional)

In Vercel → Project → Domains, add a custom domain like `temba.rw`.

---

### 8.2 Backend — Railway

The FastAPI backend requires PostgreSQL, Redis, and a persistent server — Vercel's serverless functions are not suitable for this. **Railway** is the simplest cloud platform for this stack and has a free starter tier.

#### Step 1 — Sign up at Railway

Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up with GitHub.

#### Step 2 — Create a new project

Click **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo** → select `Temba_Digital_Bridge`. Set the **Root Directory** to `temba-backend`.

#### Step 3 — Add services

In the Railway project dashboard, click `+` and add:

- **PostgreSQL** → Database → PostgreSQL
- **Redis** → Database → Redis

Railway gives you internal connection strings for each service.

#### Step 4 — Set environment variables

In Railway → your API service → Variables, add all values from Section 7. Use Railway's reference syntax:

```text
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://${{Postgres.PGUSER}}:${{Postgres.PGPASSWORD}}@${{Postgres.PGHOST}}:${{Postgres.PGPORT}}/${{Postgres.PGDATABASE}}
DATABASE_URL_SYNC=postgresql://${{Postgres.PGUSER}}:${{Postgres.PGPASSWORD}}@${{Postgres.PGHOST}}:${{Postgres.PGPORT}}/${{Postgres.PGDATABASE}}
REDIS_URL=redis://${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}/1
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}/2
```

#### Step 5 — Deploy

Railway detects the `Dockerfile` in `temba-backend/` and builds automatically. The Dockerfile runs `alembic upgrade head` before starting Uvicorn, so migrations apply on every deploy.

#### Step 6 — Run the seed script once

In Railway → your service → Shell tab:

```bash
python seed_providers.py
```

#### Step 7 — Note your public backend URL

Railway gives you a URL like `https://temba-backend.up.railway.app`. Use this in the Vercel API URL update above.

---

### 8.3 USSD in Production

For production, replace the ngrok URL with your Railway backend URL in the Africa's Talking dashboard:

- **USSD Callback URL**: `https://temba-backend.up.railway.app/api/v1/ussd/callback`

Update your Railway environment variables:

```ini
AT_USERNAME=your_production_at_username
AT_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
```

---

### 8.4 Deployment Summary

| Service | Platform | URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | Vercel | `https://temba-digital-bridge.vercel.app` |
| Backend API | Railway | `https://temba-backend.up.railway.app` |
| API Docs (Swagger) | Railway | `https://temba-backend.up.railway.app/docs` |
| USSD Channel | Africa's Talking | `*384*36640#` |
| Database | Railway (PostgreSQL 16) | internal |

## 11. Database Schema

The backend uses **PostgreSQL 16** with **SQLAlchemy 2 (async)**. Every table shares two mixins applied at the ORM level:

| Mixin | Columns added |
|---|---|
| `UUIDMixin` | `id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid4()` |
| `TimestampMixin` | `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ` |

### 11.3 Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| UUID primary keys on all tables | No sequential ID guessing; safe for distributed use |
| Rwanda location fields denormalized onto `users`, `reports`, `service_requests` | Avoids joins on the most common query patterns |
| PostgreSQL `ARRAY` for `service_categories`, `working_days`, `unavailable_dates` | Simple multi-value fields that do not warrant their own join tables |
| `sla_deadline` + `overdue_flagged` + `escalation_level` on 3 tables | Powers the hourly Celery SLA checker with 4-level escalation (officer → supervisor → regional manager → executive) |
| `reopen_count` + `first_responded_at` + `verified_at` | Inputs to the provider accountability score formula |
| `audit_logs` as append-only | Compliance requirement; tamper-evident history of every status change and user action |
| `reference_id` + `reference_type` on `notifications` | Polymorphic link to any entity type without separate FK columns per entity |
| bcrypt pinned to `3.2.2` | passlib 1.7.4 is incompatible with bcrypt ≥ 4 |
